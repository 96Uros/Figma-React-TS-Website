# Figma to React/TypeScript: Pixel-Perfect Sound Design Course App

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Sound Design Course website, recreated from Figma designs into a modern React + TypeScript codebase. The UI matches the Figma visuals closely, including spacing, typography, and interactive behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Topics Section**: Hover over each topic to display a live image preview, exactly as in the original Figma design.
- Responsive and visually consistent sections for **Info**, **Blog**, **Testimonials**, and more.
- All components are modular and reusable, mirroring Figma’s structure.
- Dedicated CSS files ensure precise style matching.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) — your app will render pixel-perfect to the Figma source.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/` — Contains all UI components (Topics, Header, Info, etc.) styled true to Figma.
- `src/App/App.tsx` — Main App layout, implements page composition as in the design.
- `src/main.tsx` — Application bootstrap and root rendering.

Created as an educational demonstration of Figma-to-React/TS conversion.
